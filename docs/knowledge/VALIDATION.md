## Implementation validation — 2026-10-25

### Deterministic test suite

Command:

```sh
npm run ci
```

Result: **PASS**

- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS, 0 warnings/0 errors (`oxlint` over 15 files).
- `npm test`: PASS, 6 test files, 56 tests.
  - `test/orchestrator.spec.ts`: 17 tests (planner, caller plan, parallel pool,
    partial, failed, evidence rejection, retry bound, fallback, oversized
    planner rejection, duplicate planner criteria, overlong verifier-criterion
    rejection, prompt/error redaction, exact criteria, URL/token prompt
    redaction).
  - `test/plugin-lifecycle.spec.ts`: 15 tests (registration, invalid input,
    startup rejection timer cleanup, startup-unload cleanup, max active runs,
    unload cancellation/disposal, canonical report filtering, contradictory
    report rejection, late startup timeout (resolve/reject), deadline report).
  - `test/loader.spec.ts`: 2 tests (real DSH Loader + real tool registry;
    disabled row inertness; registration/unregistration and prompt section).
  - `test/input.spec.ts`: 10 tests, including exact-bound, over-bound, and
    duplicate-criteria input.
  - `test/redact.spec.ts`: 10 tests, including compound environment names,
    access/private/secret keys, Stripe underscore tokens, non-HTTP URL
    userinfo, and GitLab/npm token prefixes.
  - `test/issue-watch.spec.ts`: 2 tests using a fake `gh` executable; baselines
    issues, replays a comment/new issue, asserts the untrusted-data prompt
    boundary, verifies credential-env isolation, and rejects runtime-loading
    variables from the credentials file.

Toolchain: Node `v26.8.1`, Vitest `4.1.12`, TypeScript `6.x`, DSH packages
`0.2.1-rc.2`, real `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-loader` `1.0.6`.

### Package contents

Command:

```sh
npm --cache /tmp/npm-cache-dshgw pack --dry-run
```

Result: **PASS**. Tarball `dsh-grok-workflow-0.1.0.tgz`, 27 files, about 38 kB packed
(later docs additions changed the size), includes `lib/index.js`, declarations, `cordis.patch.yml`, README,
LICENSE, and docs.

### Real DSH profile installation

Environment: isolated `DSH_HOME=/home/fish/projects_mine/dsh-grok-workflow/.dsh-home`,
profile `grok-workflow-dev`, based on the shipped `headless` template.

Command:

```sh
DSH_HOME=... dsh plugin --profile grok-workflow-dev add /home/fish/projects_mine/dsh-grok-workflow
```

Result: **PASS**. pnpm added `dsh-grok-workflow link:../../..`; profile
`dsh.profile.bundles` includes `dsh-grok-workflow`. `dsh --dump-config` shows:

```yaml
- id: grok-workflow
  name: dsh-grok-workflow
```

### Real model route smoke

Command shape (key loaded from the user's environment file without printing it):

```sh
set -a; . ~/.dsh/bifrost.env; set +a
DSH_HOME=... dsh --profile grok-workflow-dev --patch .dsh-home/gw-model.patch.yml headless "Reply with exactly: MODEL_OK"
```

Result: **PASS**. Output contained `MODEL_OK`; exit code 0. Model:
`bifrost-completions / wb/cn:deepseek-v4.1-flash` (local test override only; not
part of the plugin package).

### Real end-to-end grok_workflow run (caller plan)

Command shape:

```sh
set -a; . ~/.dsh/bifrost.env; set +a
DSH_HOME=... dsh --profile grok-workflow-dev --patch .dsh-home/gw-model.patch.yml headless --json "<prompt>"
```

Result: **PASS**.

- Session events include exactly one `tool_call` named `grok_workflow` and one
  `tool_result` with status `completed`.
- Report: `Grok workflow: COMPLETED`, plan `caller`, 2 tasks, 2 verified.
- `alpha` artifact `.dsh-home/e2e-alpha.txt` was created, 8 bytes, content
  `ALPHA_OK` with no trailing bytes.
- `beta` independently ran `expr 17 + 25`, stdout `42`, exit 0.
- Verifier evidence included actual `ls`, `od`, `wc`, Python `read_bytes`, and
  bash comparison outputs.
- Final assistant text reported `COMPLETED` with both task statuses verified.
- The audit trail (`--json`) is retained locally under `.dsh-home/` (ignored by Git).

### Real end-to-end grok_workflow run (parallel timing, completed)

Command: same profile/model override as above, with two caller tasks that each
recorded epoch milliseconds, slept 4 s, and recorded the end time.

Result: **PASS**.

- `tool_result` status: `completed`; report `Grok workflow: COMPLETED`, plan
  `caller`, 2 tasks, 2 verified, one attempt each.
- `gamma2`: start `1792908315791`, end `1792908319793` → 4002 ms.
- `delta2`: start `1792908312327`, end `1792908316329` → 4002 ms.
- The two intervals overlap by **538 ms**, so the subtasks were not serialized.
  The difference in shell start time is model/agent startup latency, not
  sequential execution; both agent calls were already in flight under the
  bounded worker pool.
- Final assistant text reported `COMPLETED` with both tasks verified.

### Real end-to-end grok_workflow run (strict partial, not reported as success)

A separate real run with deliberately misaligned task text (`objective` mentioned
an unlisted `exit 0` requirement and an unverifiable tracked-file baseline) was
correctly rejected by the independent verifier:

- `tool_result` status: `completed` at the tool transport level, report status
  `PARTIAL`.
- `gamma`: failed after 2 attempts; verifier issues were surfaced.
- `delta`: verified after 2 attempts.
- The assistant's final answer said `grok_workflow status: PARTIAL — not
  completed, so I am not claiming success.`

This is evidence that a worker's claim does not become success when the
verifier cannot support it, and that partial results remain explicit.

### Real end-to-end grok_workflow run (planner, completed)

A planner-only call (no `tasks` array) with the objective
`Create the file .dsh-home/planner-only.txt containing exactly PLANNER_ONLY, then verify its content.`
returned:

- `tool_result` status: `completed`.
- Report: `Grok workflow: COMPLETED`, `Plan: planner; 1 task(s); 1 verified`.
- Task `write-verify-planner-only`: verified after 2 attempts; evidence included
  `realpath`, `ls`, `test -f`, `cat`, `wc`, `od`, `stat`, `cmp`, and `sha256sum`.
- File content: exactly `PLANNER_ONLY` (12 bytes, no trailing newline).
- The report surfaced a planner-generated constraint that said "do not execute
  work in this planning step"; this was a planner wording defect, not a false
  success. The planner prompt was clarified to forbid planning-phase
  instructions in task constraints.

A larger planner run (two marker files plus an over-broad "no other file in
`.dsh-home` changed" criterion) was killed by the outer 600 s test timeout before
returning a report. It demonstrated that the default 30-minute plugin deadline
and bounded retries are not a substitute for realistic task scope. It is not
counted as a passed acceptance run.

### Recursion guard (real-model lesson)

The first large planner attempt spawned multiple child agents and one child
appeared to be verifying by starting more work. The plugin now rejects
`grok_workflow` calls from subagent sessions (`origin === 'subagent'` or
`delegationDepth > 0`); a deterministic test covers the rejection. This guard
was added before the successful small planner run.

### GitHub installation and workflow

Repository: `https://github.com/free6589/dsh-grok-workflow`, public, default
branch `main`; initial commit `beb55c6`, current work commit `7b78db9`.

Commands:

```sh
DSH_HOME=.dsh-home dsh --profile grok-workflow-github --from-default-profile headless --dump-config
DSH_HOME=.dsh-home dsh plugin --profile grok-workflow-github add github:free6589/dsh-grok-workflow
DSH_HOME=.dsh-home dsh --profile grok-workflow-github --dump-config
```

Result: **PASS**.

- pnpm resolved and added `dsh-grok-workflow github:free6589/dsh-grok-workflow`
  (+4 packages); it emitted only peer-dependency warnings, no install failure.
- `--dump-config` shows `- id: grok-workflow / name: dsh-grok-workflow`.
- A real headless boot replied `GITHUB_INSTALL_OK`.
- A real `grok_workflow` call in the GitHub-installed profile returned
  `COMPLETED` with one verified task; the file
  `.dsh-home/github-install-marker.txt` contains exactly
  `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_OK` (18 bytes, no trailing newline).

### GitHub Actions

- Run `40168892831` (commit `beb55c6`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40169133016` (commit `7b78db9`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40169816856` (commit `8ec3ad4`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40169885633` (commit `602918e`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40170034851` (commit `b23d360`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40172141078` (commit `6a0c32a`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs.
- Run `40175621646` (commit `b6b649b`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs;
  includes `npm run build`, `git diff --exit-code -- lib/`, and
  `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Run `40176223802` (commit `03c9a43`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs;
  watcher security tests (51 total) included.
- Run `40176627051` (commit `aa0e9bb`): **PASS**, Node 22 and Node 24 jobs;
  final documentation and live-watcher evidence.
- The workflow uses `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4`; GitHub
  reports a Node 20 deprecation annotation but both jobs completed successfully.

### Real end-to-end deadline cancellation

A real `grok_workflow` call ran with a profile overlay setting `timeoutMs: 2000`
and one task that asked the worker to `sleep 30`.

Result: **PASS**.

- `tool_result` status: `completed` at the transport level, report
  `Grok workflow: FAILED`.
- Report showed `Plan: unavailable; 0 task(s); 0 verified`, with
  `Timeout: workflow exceeded the 2000 ms deadline and was cancelled`.
- Final assistant answer reported `FAILED` and explicitly said the sleep did
  not complete.
- No leftover `sleep 30` or `dsh --profile grok-workflow-dev` process was
  observed after the call.

This is a live DSH cancellation/deadline path, not only a mocked unit test.

## Review boundary fixes (2026-10-25)

Independent review found five gaps; fixes were implemented and retested:

- Caller acceptance criteria now reject more than 20 items or more than 1,000
  characters per item instead of being silently truncated. The same bounds are
  enforced when normalizing planner output.
- Credential redaction now matches compound environment names such as
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`.
- The deadline timer is cleared in an outer `finally`, including when
  `workflowEngine.start()` rejects; a fake-timer test asserts zero pending
  timers after startup rejection.
- Obsolete pending/not-run sections were removed from this validation log.
- `engines.dsh` is now the exact `0.2.1-rc.2`, matching the exact DSH peer
  dependency set.
- **Residual re-review edge case:** verifier criterion strings are now parsed
  with `boundedText(..., 1000)`, so a 1,000-character caller criterion plus a
  suffix is rejected rather than silently truncated into a match. Regression
  test added.

### Issue-report fixes (2026-10-25)

Open issue reports #2-#7 were reproduced from source and covered by deterministic
tests:

- **#2 redaction:** `KEY_VALUE` now covers access/private/secret key names and
  compound prefixes; OpenAI-style tokens include `sk_live_` / `sk_test_`
  underscore forms. `redactSecrets` and recursive `redactDeep` tests pass.
- **#3 report invariants:** `assertWorkflowReport` now compares immutable plan
  and task fields, validates sequential attempts within the retry limit, rejects
  passed attempts on failed tasks, and enforces status invariants (`completed`
  all verified with evidence/no fallback, `partial` mixed, `failed` no verified
  tasks).
- **#4 startup deadline:** a deadline that elapses while `start()` is pending
  now returns the canonical timeout report whether startup later resolves or
  rejects; the late run is cancelled and disposed.
- **#5 prompt redaction:** worker/verifier results and error messages are
  redacted inside the generated script before being serialized into verifier
  and retry prompts; regression tests assert fake markers never reach prompts.
- **#6 duplicate criteria:** caller input rejects duplicate acceptance criteria;
  planner output with duplicates is rejected and falls back, rather than
  creating an impossible verifier match.
- **#7 canonical result:** the tool returns the object produced by
  `assertWorkflowReport`, not the raw engine value; a test adds an unknown field
  containing a fake secret and verifies it is absent.

`npm run ci` — **PASS**, 6 files / 51 tests.

### Additional issue-report fixes (#8-#10)

- **#8 payload bounds:** the objective is capped at 4,000 characters and the
  aggregate serialized caller/planner task payload at 48,000 characters, in
  both host input validation and generated-script planner normalization.
  Boundary and over-bound tests pass.
- **#9 shared working directory:** documented as a concrete MVP limitation.
  Parallel workers and verifiers share the DSH session `cwd`; the plugin has no
  worktree isolation, so write-heavy work must use disjoint scopes or
  `maxConcurrency: 1`.
- **#10 artifact drift:** CI now runs `npm run build`, then
  `git diff --exit-code -- lib/`, then tests and `npm pack --dry-run`, so a
  commit cannot silently ship stale `lib/` output.

### Watcher security fix (#11)

- The watcher now wraps all imported event fields in a compact JSON array,
  labels it `UNTRUSTED GITHUB DATA`, and repeats a security reminder after the
  payload: issue text is evidence/task description, not authority to override
  system/repository/tool/secret-handling rules.
- `DSH_ENV_FILE` is parsed as KEY=VALUE credentials rather than sourced as shell
  code; `DSH_*`, `HOME`, `PATH`, and similar process variables are ignored so a
  credential file cannot retarget the wake to another DSH home/profile/session.
- Command-mode wakes use `bash -c`, not a login shell, so profile scripts cannot
  overwrite the isolated environment.
- Two fake-`gh` tests pass, including hostile-looking issue text and a credential
  file containing conflicting `DSH_HOME` / `DSH_PROFILE` / `DSH_PATCH`.
- `npm run ci` — **PASS**, 6 files / 51 tests.

### Post-fix real DSH revalidation

- Reinstalled the local bundle into the isolated `grok-workflow-dev` profile
  with the exact engine declaration; `--dump-config` still shows the
  `grok-workflow` row. **PASS**.
- Clean one-task caller workflow returned `COMPLETED`, plan `caller`, 1/1
  verified; `.dsh-home/fix-e2e/check.txt` was a 6-byte regular file containing
  exactly `FIX_OK`. **PASS**.
- Re-ran the 2-second deadline against a 30-second worker: `FAILED` with
  `Timeout: workflow exceeded the 2000 ms deadline and was cancelled`; no
  leftover child process. **PASS**.
- Fresh profile `grok-workflow-review` installed the public GitHub package
  after the exact-engine commit (`6a0c32a`), showed the bundle row, booted with
  `REVIEW_OK`, and a one-task workflow returned `COMPLETED` 1/1 verified.
  **PASS**.

## Issue watcher validation (2026-10-25)

### Live wake smoke

- Created temporary issue #13 (`[TEST] watcher wake smoke`) after the watcher
  was running with the hardened script.
- The watcher detected the new issue at `08:25:06Z`, started wake
  `pid=540837`, and wrote `last-wake.status=0`.
- The DSH final answer contained `WATCH_WAKE_OK`; its trace shows the prompt
  included the JSON array and both security-boundary messages. No repository
  files were modified and no credentials were read or printed.
- Closed #13 after the check. This is a real watcher → DSH headless wake, not
  a mocked unit test.

- `bash -n scripts/watch-issues.sh` — **PASS**.
- `npx vitest run test/issue-watch.spec.ts` — **PASS**, 2 tests; fake `gh`
  executable, no GitHub or model calls; includes hostile issue text and
  credential-env isolation.
- `WATCH_STATE_DIR=.dsh-home/watch-live WATCH_WAKE_MODE=noop scripts/watch-issues.sh --once`
  — **PASS**; baselined 10 open issues at 08:02 UTC with no wake.
- Real DSH headless stdin smoke:
  `printf 'Reply with exactly: WAKE_SMOKE_OK\n' | dsh --profile grok-workflow-dev --patch .dsh-home/gw-model.patch.yml --json`
  — **PASS**; final text `WAKE_SMOKE_OK`. The watcher uses the same
  `--profile ... --patch ... --json` argument shape and feeds the prompt on
  stdin.
- The live watcher is started separately; its state and logs stay under the
  ignored `.dsh-home/` directory.

### Credential redaction formats (#14)

- Reproduced on the built `lib/redact.js` from `99454d1`: both database URLs
  (`postgres://demo_user:FAKE_DB_PASSWORD@...`, `mongodb+srv://...`) and bare
  `glpat-...` / `npm_...` values passed through unchanged.
- `src/redact.ts` now matches username/password userinfo for any `scheme://`
  URI, including database schemes and empty-username forms such as
  `redis://:password@host`; it also recognizes `glpat-` and `npm_` token
  prefixes. `src/script.ts` carries the same patterns for prompt-facing
  redaction.
- Regression tests added in `test/redact.spec.ts` for `redactSecrets` and
  `redactDeep`, and in `test/orchestrator.spec.ts` for verifier/retry prompts.
- `npx vitest run test/redact.spec.ts test/orchestrator.spec.ts` — **PASS**,
  2 files / 26 tests.
- `npm run ci` — **PASS**, 6 files / 55 tests.
- Post-fix check on the built artifact: the issue examples return `[REDACTED]`
  markers while ordinary prose (`ratio 3:4 at example.test`) is unchanged.

### Watcher credential-env allowlist (#15)

- `bash -n scripts/watch-issues.sh` — **PASS**.
- `npx vitest run test/issue-watch.spec.ts` — **PASS**, 2 tests; the
  credentials file contains inert `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`,
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_*`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, `PERL5OPT`,
  `RUBYOPT`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `SHELLOPTS`, `BASHOPTS`, and an unlisted
  setting; the command wake does not receive any of them, while
  `BIFROST_VIRTUAL_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` still arrive.
- `bash scripts/watch-issues.sh --help` — **PASS**; it describes
  `DSH_ENV_FILE` as a parsed `KEY=VALUE` credentials file, not a sourced
  environment file.
- `npm run ci` — **PASS**, 6 files / 55 tests.
- Live watcher restart: **PASS** at `08:54:06Z`; new PID `568469`, state
  retained, `DSH_SESSION_ID`/profile overrides absent, first poll `no changes`.
  The prior live wake (`WATCH_WAKE_OK`, status 0) used the previous script.

### Fallback partial host validation (#17)

- Issue #17: a planner fallback creates one task, verifies it, and the script
  deliberately reports `partial` because planning was degraded. The host
  `assertWorkflowReport()` previously rejected that report because its
  `partial` invariant required both verified and failed tasks.
- `src/report.ts` now accepts `partial` with all tasks verified only when
  `plan.source === 'fallback'` and `plan.error` is non-empty. It still rejects
  an all-verified non-fallback `partial` report, keeps `partial` requiring at
  least one verified task, and keeps fallback `completed` forbidden.
- `test/orchestrator.spec.ts` now runs the generated fallback report through
  the real host validator and also checks the non-fallback rejection. The suite
  has 17 orchestrator tests and 6 files / 56 tests total.
- `npm run ci` — **PASS**, 6 files / 56 tests.

## Remaining gap

- Clean-DSH-profile installation is executed locally; CI has not yet added a
  separate clean-profile install job.


### Homepage PR #16 — merged and locally rechecked

- PR #16 merged to `main` as `ea3e8e31`; CI runs `40178081351`, `40178539805`, and `40178848058` passed on Node 22 and Node 24.
- Root README is a concise English quick-start; `README.zh-CN.md` is the full Simplified Chinese counterpart. Both link to each other at the top.
- Added `docs/images/workflow-overview.svg` and `docs/images/workflow-overview.zh-CN.svg`; both parse as well-formed XML.
- Added `README.zh-CN.md` to `package.json` `files`; current `npm pack --dry-run` lists both READMEs and 33 total files (63.1 kB package). The published v0.1.0 asset predates the `CHANGELOG.md` package addition and has 31 files.
- The merged PR initially omitted the explicit configuration table, disable/uninstall, security, and compatibility sections; the local follow-up restored compact equivalents in both languages.
- **Install-order review finding:** the first README revision told users to run `dsh plugin add` before creating a missing profile. In an isolated `DSH_HOME` check, `plugin add` auto-created a base-only profile; the later `--from-default-profile headless` rewrote that profile and removed the installed plugin dependency.
- **Correction:** both READMEs and `docs/LOCAL-TESTING.md` now create the headless profile first, then install the plugin, and explicitly warn not to run `--from-default-profile` after `plugin add`.
- Install command verified against project metadata: `dsh plugin --profile grok-workflow-dev add github:free6589/dsh-grok-workflow`; requirements remain DSH `0.2.1-rc.2`, Node.js >=22, and a profile with workflow/subagent services.


### First release v0.1.0 — published

- PR #18 merged to `main` as `7904e23`; main CI `40182707932` passed on Node 22 and Node 24.
- First tag-triggered release run `40182588171` failed in the changelog extractor: the regex literal contained an extra backslash from the YAML/heredoc escaping.
- Fixed in `a7d5a62` (`fix: correct changelog section regex in release workflow`); the tag was recreated at that commit before any GitHub Release existed.
- Final tag `v0.1.0` (tag object `f175ada8a7533a5f61c06a75e5a457e32b37579b`) points to `a7d5a6267c471a6ed73e44ac02092f59942c508a`.
- Release workflow `40182751006` — **PASS** on **Node 22 only**, including typecheck, lint, build, `lib/` consistency, tests, package checks, and release creation. Main CI `40182707932` covered Node 22/24.
- GitHub Release: https://github.com/free6589/dsh-grok-workflow/releases/tag/v0.1.0; asset `dsh-grok-workflow-0.1.0.tgz` (61,281 bytes).
- **NOT_RUN:** local DSH install from the `#v0.1.0` spec. The release/tag and asset are published; tag-pinned installation still needs a separate isolated-profile smoke test.
