# Agent Handoff

## 2026-10-27 — v0.2.0 released and installed on the operator machine

- **Released:** `v0.2.0` tag + GitHub Release (tgz 42 files / 108,428 B, sha256 recorded by GitHub). CI and Release workflows green. `v0.1.0` untouched.
- **Installed:** real profiles `headless` and `web` (layerfs root), locked to `#v0.2.0`. Web GUI service restarted with the plugin composed.
- **Test matrix:** 8/10 PASS on real installs with real models (VALIDATION.md "0.2.0 real-profile install matrix"); 2 NOT_RUN are GUI-interactive checks for the operator (settings page rendering in browser, web chat behavior).
- **Rollback:** `dsh plugin --profile <p> remove dsh-grok-workflow`; backups under `~/dsh-profile-backups/`.
- **Operator checklist (morning):** send a chat message in the GUI and confirm a workflow report (not a direct answer); open Settings and confirm the auto-generated `grok-workflow` page renders; judge in-turn latency comfort (adjust timeoutMs/maxTasks or request progress hints per U-9).
- **Next action:** fix loop per D-011 on any failure (patch bump, new tag, reinstall, retest); backlog: chain-editor UI (Phase 9), streaming progress, relay/append GUI evidence (NR-1 half).


## 2026-10-26 — Security observation (captain integration note)

- During t15's writesPaths experiment a workflow subagent inherited session tools including git and committed `docs/plan-a.md` as `e38ac8e` (`dsh-agent@localhost`) without authorization. Artifacts removed in the v0.2.0 release batch; history kept intact deliberately (audit trail).
- Risk: subagents of the workflow inherit the parent session's toolset — including VCS write access. Operators running the workflow in profiles with git-capable tools should treat this as a documented limitation (see WORKFLOW-DESIGN limits). Mitigation options for future versions: tool pre-execute deny list for subagents, or documented operator guidance.
- The plugin's own recursion guard blocks workflow re-entry in subagents, but it cannot (and does not) restrict which unrelated tools a workflow subagent may call.


## 2026-10-26 — Round 2 (phases 1–7): mandatory entry, routing, settings, reliability, release prep

- **From:** local team (AgentTeams dshgw-workflow-planning), implementer + independent reviewers
- **To:** captain / next local agent / independent reviewer
- **Base commit:** `bd1f261` (U-4 write-path isolation; phase 6 landed in `32a7f4a`)
- **Package version:** `0.2.0` (tag and GitHub Release **not yet created** — the captain creates them after the final acceptance pass)
- **Release-readiness artefacts:**
  - `docs/releases/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.0.md` — human draft of the announcement, artifact table
    (`0.1.0`: 33 files / 61,281 B → `0.2.0`: 42 files / 107,991 B) and operator steps pointing at
    [RELEASING](../RELEASING.md).
  - `scripts/smoke-settings-identity.mjs` — feeds the **built** plugin the descriptor produced by
    the DSH installation's own `dsh-settings` projection and prints the diagnostics line; the
    end-to-end check for the t31/F1 identity fix.
  - `test/settings-fixture.ts` + `test/settings-projection.spec.ts` — the settings descriptor is
    no longer hand-shaped: the runtime's projection rules are applied, the measured facts are
    pinned, and the transcription is cross-checked against the real module when discoverable.
- **What is now true:**
  - The gate claims every user message through `agent/pre-step` and answers it
    from a validated report in the same turn (`in-turn`, the default;
    `enforceGate: true` is the default, `gateRequired` turns a missing hook into a
    load error).
  - Per-role ordered fallback chains (`roles.{planner,worker,verifier,synthesizer}`,
    ≤3 routes), a `switchOn` whitelist, and routing recorded in the report.
  - Failure `class` + `category` (`infrastructure`/`quality`/`configuration`/
    `cancelled`/`unknown`) end to end, including a rendered `Failures:` line.
  - A live settings surface derived from the exported `Config`: unknown keys
    rejected with a suggestion, chains validated against the runtime's providers,
    edits apply to the next message with a last-good fallback.
  - Write-path isolation (U-4): `writesPaths` per task, conflict-aware pool,
    normalized lexical overlap, echoed in the report.
  - Documentation set synchronized: README (EN + zh), CHANGELOG (bilingual
    `0.2.0`), DESIGN (DD-1..DD-9b + NR ledger), ROADMAP (phases marked), STATE,
    DECISIONS (D-009..D-012), ARCHITECTURE, VALIDATION.
- **Tests run:** `npm run ci` — PASS: typecheck, lint 0/0, build, **264 tests / 18
  files**. `lib/` reproducible (identical md5 before/after rebuild). Clean-copy
  `npm ci` + `npm run ci` PASS. `npm pack` contents verified. Isolated-profile
  install of the packed tarball PASS.
- **Local runtime verified:** real headless one-shot run with a live model passes
  the delivery assertion (`scripts/e2e-headless-in-turn.sh`: PASS, `Grok workflow:
  COMPLETED`), and the explicit-refusal path was measured twice in t14.
- **Honest gaps (do not read these as done):** NR-1 (GUI/long-lived delivery
  half), NR-5 (real provider failure texts), NR-6 (real-provider route switching
  end to end), NR-7 (stock form rendering of `roles`), NR-8 (in-place settings
  `update()` against a live holder), NR-9 (planner fill-rate for `writesPaths`).
- **Blockers:** none technical. The remaining release steps need the captain:
  create `v0.2.0`, publish the GitHub Release, and never move `v0.1.0`.
- **Next action:** t16 final acceptance on the packed artifact, then tag + Release
  per `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## 2026-10-25 — Workflow planning round 1 (audits → synthesis → review → revision)

- **From:** local team lead (AgentTeams dshgw-workflow-planning)
- **To:** cloud reviewer / next local agent
- **Base commit:** b231660 → **work commit:** 2403a10 (see git log for the round's commits: 023887d criterion fix, d82c245 synthesis, 0672de6 revision, 2403a10 QA-2 batch)
- **Changes:** Four independent read-only audits (architecture / DSH 0.2.1-rc.2 API / model routing / security+testing) with source-line evidence; two live experiments (t18 B-1 delivery routes, t19 H-1..H-5 API capability probes); synthesis + independent review (21 findings) + revision of WORKFLOW-ROADMAP.md and WORKFLOW-DESIGN.md; QA batch: criterion normalization fix (t20, 023887d) and report validation/redaction/engine-contract batch (t21, 2403a10).
- **Tests run:** `npm run ci` PASS — 106 tests / 9 files (was 56); clean-copy `npm ci` + `npm run ci` PASS; t20 independently re-verified with isolated-snapshot mutation testing (t22, PASS on t20 portion).
- **Local runtime verified:** t18/t19 experiments ran against real installed DSH 0.2.1-rc.2 in isolated DSH_HOME profiles (enter/reject/relay/source.kind/plugin-record behaviors). NOT_RUN: web long-lived keep-alive, relay multi-sample, (a') write ordering, settings nested write to disk (NR-1..NR-4 in WORKFLOW-DESIGN).
- **Key verdict:** mandatory entry is **partially feasible** as an external plugin (4 guarantees runtime-verified, 4 only conditional). See WORKFLOW-ROADMAP §5.3 and DESIGN A-14 for the exact split and the minimal upstream changes if unconditional guarantees are required.
- **Blockers:** none technical. U-1..U-7 product tradeoffs await user decision (answer route, retry ownership, synthesizer, shared-dir policy, strict-mode cost, YAML-first, enforcement scope).
- **Next action:** user decides U-1..U-7; then implement in the agreed phase order (gate+delivery unit first if the user keeps entry-first priority). QA-2 independent re-review (t22b) runs in parallel.


## 2026-10-25 — First release v0.1.0

- **From:** local release operator
- **To:** cloud reviewer / next local agent
- **Base commit:** `7904e23` (PR #18 merge)
- **Work commit:** `a7d5a62` (`fix: correct changelog section regex in release workflow`)
- **Tag:** `v0.1.0` (tag object `f175ada8a7533a5f61c06a75e5a457e32b37579b`) → `a7d5a6267c471a6ed73e44ac02092f59942c508a`
- **Changes:**
  - Created and pushed the annotated `v0.1.0` tag after PR #18 merged and main CI passed.
  - First release run `40182588171` failed because the changelog-boundary regex had an extra backslash from YAML/heredoc escaping; fixed `a7d5a62`, then recreated the tag before any release existed.
  - Final release run `40182751006` created the GitHub Release and attached `dsh-grok-workflow-0.1.0.tgz`.
- **Tests run:** release workflow `40182751006` — PASS on Node 22 only, including typecheck, lint, build, `lib/` consistency, tests, package checks, and attachment. Main CI `40182707932` covered Node 22/24.
- **Test results:** PASS.
- **Local runtime verified:** yes for tag-pinned installation/config composition in an isolated `DSH_HOME`; a real `grok_workflow` model call was **NOT_RUN**. Release publication is confirmed by GitHub.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** optionally smoke-test `dsh plugin ... add github:free6589/dsh-grok-workflow#v0.1.0` in an isolated profile; do not move the published tag.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #17 fallback partial validation

- **From:** local agent (watcher wake for issue #17)
- **To:** cloud reviewer / next local agent
- **Base commit:** `a2b2f9f`
- **Work commit:** `9c2cc29` (`fix: accept verified fallback reports as partial`)
- **Changes:**
  - Host validation now permits a fallback plan whose single task is verified
    to remain `partial`, provided the planning error is present.
  - Non-fallback `partial` still requires both verified and failed tasks;
    fallback plans can never be `completed`; `partial` still requires at least
    one verified task.
  - Added a host-validation regression test using the real generated fallback
    report, plus the existing orchestrator coverage.
- **Tests run:**
  - `npx vitest run test/orchestrator.spec.ts` — PASS, 17 tests.
  - `npm run ci` — PASS, 6 files / 56 tests.
  - `git diff --exit-code -- lib/` — PASS after build.
- **Test results:** PASS.
- **Local runtime verified:** no; this is deterministic report validation
  logic, not a DSH lifecycle change.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** cloud review `9c2cc29`; issue #17 remains open until review.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #15 watcher credential-env allowlist

- **From:** local agent
- **To:** cloud reviewer / next local agent
- **Base commit:** `0476fa7` (`docs: record issue 14 redaction fix`)
- **Work commit:** `61d63b4` (`fix: restrict watcher credential env keys`)
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced the watcher's permissive env-file denylist with an explicit
    allowlist for provider credentials/configuration (`BIFROST_*`, `*_API_KEY`,
    `*_TOKEN`, `*_BASE_URL`, `*_API_VERSION`, and selected cloud settings).
  - Runtime/code-loading names such as `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`,
    `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_*`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`,
    `PERL5OPT`, `RUBYOPT`, `BASH_ENV`, and `ENV` are denied even if a future
    pattern becomes broader.
  - Updated `--help` and `docs/ISSUE-WATCHER.md` to state that the file is
    parsed as `KEY=VALUE`, never sourced.
- **Tests run:**
  - `bash -n scripts/watch-issues.sh` — PASS.
  - `npx vitest run test/issue-watch.spec.ts` — PASS, 2 tests.
  - `npm run ci` — PASS, 6 files / 55 tests.
- **Test results:** PASS.
- **Local runtime verified:** yes after restart at `08:54:06Z` (PID `568469`);
  the previous live wake (`WATCH_WAKE_OK`, status 0) was on the prior script.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** cloud review `e26e297`; PR #16 needs separate README review.

## 2026-10-25 — Issue #14 credential redaction fix

- **From:** local agent
- **To:** cloud reviewer / next local agent
- **Base commit:** `99454d1a830ca42ed051d232de4104161357b581`
- **Work commit:** `24b6619` (`fix: redact non-HTTP URL userinfo and scoped tokens`); docs follow-up commit after it
- **Changes:**
  - Extended `src/redact.ts` URL userinfo matching from `http(s)` to any
    `scheme://` URI (covers `postgres`, `postgresql`, `mongodb+srv`, `redis`,
    etc., including empty-username `redis://:password@host`).
  - Added `glpat-` (GitLab) and `npm_` token patterns.
  - Mirrored the same patterns in the `redactPromptText` copy inside
    `src/script.ts`.
  - Added `redactSecrets`, `redactDeep`, and verifier/retry prompt regression
    tests with fake values.
- **Tests run:**
  - `npm run typecheck` — PASS.
  - `npm run lint` — PASS, 0 warnings/0 errors.
  - `npx vitest run test/redact.spec.ts test/orchestrator.spec.ts` — PASS,
    26 tests.
  - `npm run ci` — PASS, 6 files / 55 tests.
- **Test results:** PASS.
- **Local runtime verified:** no for this change; it is redaction logic covered
  by deterministic unit and prompt-rendering tests, not a DSH lifecycle change.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** cloud review of `24b6619`; do not use real credentials in
  future regression vectors.

## 2026-10-25 — Implementation and local runtime verification

- **From:** local lead agent
- **To:** next local/cloud agent
- **Base commit:** none (empty repo; first push `beb55c6`)
- **Work commit:** remote `main` at final handoff (use `git rev-parse origin/main`)
- **Changes:**
  - Added the full external DSH bundle (`src/`, `lib/`, `cordis.patch.yml`,
    package manifest, README, docs).
  - Added deterministic and real-Loader tests.
  - Updated `STATE.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`, `RESEARCH.md`.
- **Tests run:**
  - `npm run ci` — typecheck, lint, 51 tests pass.
  - `npm run test:loader` — 2 real Loader tests pass.
  - `npm pack --dry-run` — package contents verified.
  - Real DSH install from local checkout and from GitHub; `--dump-config`
    shows the bundle row in both profiles.
  - Real headless model smoke and real `grok_workflow` runs (see
    `VALIDATION.md`).
- **Test results:** PASS; GitHub Actions run `40176627051` passed Node 22/24, including watcher security tests, build-artifact consistency, and pack checks (51 tests).
- **Local runtime verified:** yes for plugin load, model route, completed
  caller-plan workflow, completed parallel timing workflow, completed
  planner-only workflow, fresh GitHub-installed workflow, a partial
  strict-failure workflow, and a live deadline cancellation.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** independent re-review of the current head; optionally add a
  clean-profile install check to CI. Do not modify the active
  `/home/fish/dsh-layerfs` home; the verified install is isolated under the
  workspace `.dsh-home`.


## 2026-10-25 — Cloud homepage redesign

- **From:** cloud
- **To:** local
- **Task:** Beginner-friendly bilingual repository homepage.
- **Base commit:** `99454d1a830ca42ed051d232de4104161357b581`.
- **Branch:** `docs/beginner-friendly-bilingual-homepage`.
- **Changes:** Replaced root `README.md` with a shorter English quick-start homepage; added `README.zh-CN.md`; added separate English and Chinese SVG workflow illustrations; updated `package.json` files allowlist to include the Chinese README; installation command and DSH/Node requirements are derived from current project files.
- **Tests:** GitHub Actions run `40178081351` PASS on Node 22/24: `npm ci`, typecheck, lint, build, `git diff --exit-code -- lib/`, `npm test`, and `npm pack --dry-run`. No real DSH runtime is claimed for this documentation-only change.
- **PR:** https://github.com/free6589/dsh-grok-workflow/pull/16 (merged as `ea3e8e31`).
- **Next action:** PR merged. Local follow-up restored the compact configuration, disable/uninstall, testing, security, and compatibility sections in both READMEs, and corrected the install order: create a missing headless profile before `plugin add`. Keep the English and Chinese pages synchronized.
