# Agent Handoff

## 2026-10-25 — Implementation and local runtime verification

- **From:** local lead agent
- **To:** next local/cloud agent
- **Base commit:** none (empty repo; first push `beb55c6`)
- **Work commit:** remote `main` at final handoff (use `git rev-parse origin/main`)
- **Changes:**
  - Added the full external DSH bundle (`src/`, `lib/`, `cordis.patch.yml`,
    package manifest, README, docs).
  - Added deterministic and real-Loader tests.
  - Updated `STATE.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`, `RESEARCH.md`.
- **Tests run:**
  - `npm run ci` — typecheck, lint, 51 tests pass.
  - `npm run test:loader` — 2 real Loader tests pass.
  - `npm pack --dry-run` — package contents verified.
  - Real DSH install from local checkout and from GitHub; `--dump-config`
    shows the bundle row in both profiles.
  - Real headless model smoke and real `grok_workflow` runs (see
    `VALIDATION.md`).
- **Test results:** PASS; GitHub Actions run `40175621646` passed Node 22/24, including build-artifact consistency and pack checks (51 tests).
- **Local runtime verified:** yes for plugin load, model route, completed
  caller-plan workflow, completed parallel timing workflow, completed
  planner-only workflow, fresh GitHub-installed workflow, a partial
  strict-failure workflow, and a live deadline cancellation.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Next action:** independent re-review of the current head; optionally add a
  clean-profile install check to CI. Do not modify the active
  `/home/fish/dsh-layerfs` home; the verified install is isolated under the
  workspace `.dsh-home`.
